# Boost and Beman: C++ Library Evolution's Past and Future

Boost C++ Libraries, founded in March 1998, has served as the primary incubator for C++ standard library features for over 25 years, with approximately **20 major libraries transitioning from Boost to the C++ standard**. The recently established Beman Project, founded at C++Now 2024 and named in memory of Boost co-founder Beman Dawes, represents a focused modern approach to standardization that complements rather than replaces Boost's broader mission. While Boost's standardization contributions peaked during its "golden era" (1998-2011) with 12 libraries entering C++11, both projects now operate under the Boost Foundation umbrella with distinct but complementary roles in C++ library evolution.

## The genesis of Boost changed C++ forever

The idea for Boost emerged at the C++ Standards Committee meeting in **Sophia Antipolis, France in March 1998**, when Robert Klarer and Beman Dawes identified a critical weakness in the C++ ecosystem. The standard library was limited in functionality, and while numerous third-party libraries existed, they lacked shared style and interoperability. Most importantly, there was no established environment for creating high-quality, non-proprietary libraries that could compete with the growing threat from Java and C#, which had corporate backing and richer library ecosystems.

**Beman Dawes** (1939-2020), a software developer from Virginia who had served on the C++ Standards Committee since 1992 and chaired the Library Working Group during C++98's completion, partnered with **Dave Abrahams** and **Robert Klarer** to create what would become the most influential third-party library collection in C++ history. The name "Boost" was deliberately chosen to represent their goal of boosting the C++ language and its library ecosystem to new heights. By 1999, they released their first official version containing 24 libraries, establishing a peer-review process that would become legendary for its rigor.

The organizational structure Dawes and his co-founders established was revolutionary for its time: a community-driven federation where each library author retained final authority over their work, but libraries only gained acceptance through formal review—a social technology where peers could interrogate authors on mailing lists and debate merits before providing written recommendations. This process ensured that only libraries adhering to best practices and demonstrating portability across compilers and platforms would be accepted.

## Boost's pipeline to the standard transformed C++ fundamentals

The relationship between Boost and the C++ standardization process has never been formal, but its effectiveness stems from **extensive personnel overlap**—many Boost founders and contributors also serve on the C++ standards committee (WG21). This human bridge created an informal but highly effective pipeline where successful Boost libraries could establish "existing practice" before standardization, providing the committee with battle-tested implementations rather than theoretical designs.

The standardization process typically follows a predictable pattern: **1-3 years** for initial Boost library development, **2-5 years** for community adoption and field experience, **1-2 years** for WG21 proposal development, **2-4 years** for committee design evolution and wording, and finally alignment with the 3-year standard publication cycle. The journey from Boost library to standard feature averages **8-15 years**, though some libraries like filesystem took 19 years from initial development to inclusion in C++17.

The technical criteria for adoption have evolved but consistently emphasize **portability requirements**, **interoperability potential** in public APIs, **years of field experience**, design **maturity without obsolescence**, and the size of the target audience. Libraries undergo significant changes during standardization, including performance optimizations (as seen with std::regex), API simplifications for broader adoption, integration with existing standard library conventions, and compliance with C++ memory models for thread and exception safety.

## Twenty libraries made the journey from Boost to standard

The "golden era" of Boost standardization occurred with C++11, which adopted **12 major Boost libraries** in a single standard. These foundational contributions reshaped modern C++: **Boost.SmartPtr** became std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr, and std::weak_ptr, fundamentally changing C++ memory management. **Boost.Thread** provided std::thread, std::mutex, and threading primitives that made concurrent programming accessible. **Boost.Regex** brought regular expressions to the standard library. **Boost.Random** established modern random number generation facilities. The functional programming trio of **Boost.Bind**, **Boost.Function**, and **Boost.Tuple** became std::bind, std::function, and std::tuple respectively.

C++11 also incorporated **Boost.Chrono** for time abstractions, **Boost.Array** as std::array for fixed-size containers, **Boost.Ref** as std::reference_wrapper, and the extensive metaprogramming utilities from **Boost.TypeTraits** and **Boost.EnableIf**. Each transition involved careful adaptation—for instance, std::tuple leveraged variadic templates unavailable when Boost.Tuple was created, while smart pointers required careful consideration of exception safety guarantees.

The C++17 standard marked another significant wave of adoptions, though at a slower pace. **Boost.Optional**, **Boost.Variant**, and **Boost.Any** became vocabulary types std::optional, std::variant, and std::any, providing type-safe alternatives to traditional C++ patterns. **Boost.Filesystem**, originally developed by Beman Dawes himself in 1998, finally entered the standard as std::filesystem after nearly two decades of refinement. Special mathematical functions from **Boost.Math** also gained standardization.

By C++23, the pipeline had slowed considerably, with only **boost::container::flat_map** partially contributing to std::flat_map and **Boost.Stacktrace** influencing std::stacktrace. This decline reflects both the success of the model—most fundamental libraries have already been standardized—and changes in the ecosystem where library authors increasingly prefer direct standardization over the lengthy Boost review process.

## The timeline reveals patterns in feature maturation

The most instructive example of the Boost-to-standard timeline is **std::filesystem**, which demonstrates both the thoroughness and challenges of the process. Beman Dawes first developed Boost.Filesystem in 1998, addressing the critical need for portable file operations. By 2003, it had achieved widespread adoption, proving its design through extensive field use. The formal standardization process began in 2006, leading to a Technical Specification in 2012, and finally inclusion in C++17—a **19-year journey** that produced one of the most universally useful standard library additions.

Smart pointers followed a more compressed but still substantial timeline. Initial development began in 1999, with widespread community adoption by 2003. When C++11 standardization efforts began in 2005, smart pointers were prime candidates, ultimately shipping in 2011 after **12 years** of evolution. The shorter timeline reflected both urgent need—manual memory management was C++'s greatest weakness—and clearer design consensus within the community.

These timelines reveal important patterns: libraries addressing fundamental pain points move faster through standardization, those requiring extensive platform-specific implementation (like filesystem) take longer, and features with multiple competing designs require additional years for consensus building. The process also demonstrates that **field experience remains irreplaceable**—no amount of committee discussion substitutes for years of real-world usage across diverse codebases.

## Beman Project emerged to modernize the standardization pipeline

At C++Now 2024 in Aspen, Colorado (April 29 - May 3), **David Sankel** of Adobe announced the Beman Project, named in memory of Beman Dawes who had passed away on December 1, 2020. This new initiative, with Sankel joined by co-leaders **Jeff Garland** (assistant chair of the Library Working Group) and **Inbal Levi** (chair of the Library Evolution Working Group at Microsoft), represents a focused attempt to streamline the path from implementation to standardization.

The Beman Project differs fundamentally from Boost in its mission and scope. While Boost serves the broader C++ community with libraries that may never target standardization, Beman **exclusively accepts libraries with intent to submit for ISO standardization**. There's no formal review process like Boost's rigorous peer review system; instead, project leads provide oversight and guidance. The project leverages modern development infrastructure including GitHub Codespaces, standardized CI/CD pipelines, and contemporary packaging approaches that didn't exist when Boost was founded.

Currently hosting **13 libraries across 30 repositories**, Beman focuses on upcoming standard proposals. Production-ready libraries include **beman.optional** for C++26 extensions to std::optional. Libraries under development target specific proposals: **beman.scope** implements RAII scope_guard facilities for C++29 (P3610), **beman.task** provides coroutine task implementation (P3552), and **beman.any_view** offers generalized type-erased views (P3411). Each library requires an accompanying standardization paper, ensuring tight coupling with the committee process from inception.

## Complementary missions define the future relationship

The relationship between Boost and Beman is explicitly complementary rather than competitive, with both projects operating under the **Boost Foundation's organizational umbrella**. The Foundation's official position emphasizes that "both projects are valuable and part of The Boost Foundation's mission to develop high quality, expert reviewed, legally unencumbered, open-source libraries and inspire standard enhancements."

Boost maintains its broader mission of serving the general C++ community with high-quality libraries regardless of standardization potential. Libraries like **Boost.Python** for Python bindings, **Boost.Spirit** for parsing, and **Boost.Compute** for GPU programming exemplify Boost's value beyond the standardization pipeline. Recent additions including **Bloom** (probabilistic filters), **Hash2** (enhanced hashing), and **MQTT5** (IoT messaging) in version 1.89.0 (August 2024) demonstrate continued innovation in domain-specific areas.

Beman's laser focus on standardization candidates offers advantages Boost's broader scope cannot provide: lower barriers to contribution without formal review requirements, direct integration with proposal processes from day one, modern tooling assumptions without legacy compatibility constraints, and explicit committee member involvement in project leadership. This specialization allows rapid iteration on standardization candidates while Boost maintains its role as a comprehensive library collection.

## Current ecosystem health shows active development continues

Both projects demonstrate healthy activity levels that suggest viable long-term futures. Boost released version **1.89.0 in August 2024** with one new library and 28 updates, maintaining its regular release schedule with version 1.90.0 planned for December 2025. The C++ Alliance provides institutional support with **11 staff members**, while modernization efforts include a new website (boost.io), improved CI/CD infrastructure, and C++20 Modules support across multiple libraries.

Several Boost libraries remain in the standardization pipeline for future standards. **Networking** (based on Boost.Asio) continues its long march toward standardization, **Expected** offers Rust-style error handling, **Static_vector** provides compile-time sized containers, **Safe** addresses memory safety concerns, and **Process** enables system process management. The historical pattern suggests these libraries may appear in C++26 or C++29, though the timeline has become less predictable than during the golden era.

The Beman Project, despite being less than a year old, shows impressive momentum with active development across its library collection. Community engagement through conference presentations at CppCon 2024 and Meeting C++ 2024, combined with an active Discourse forum, suggests growing adoption. The project's modern infrastructure—including GitHub Codespaces for easy development access and standardized templates for consistency—lowers contribution barriers significantly compared to traditional development approaches.

## Conclusion

The evolution from Boost's pioneering library incubation model to the focused standardization approach of the Beman Project reflects the maturation of both the C++ language and its community. While Boost's golden era of massive standardization contributions has passed—with 12 libraries entering C++11 compared to minimal additions in C++23—this shift represents success rather than decline. The fundamental libraries that every C++ programmer needs have been standardized, allowing both projects to pursue more specialized missions.

Boost continues innovating in domain-specific areas while maintaining critical legacy support, serving millions of developers who rely on its extensive ecosystem. The Beman Project, by focusing exclusively on standardization candidates with modern tooling and direct committee involvement, offers a streamlined path for the next generation of standard library features. Together, they honor Beman Dawes's vision of advancing C++ through excellent libraries while adapting to contemporary development practices and community needs. The future of C++ library evolution lies not in choosing between these approaches but in leveraging their complementary strengths to serve an increasingly diverse and sophisticated developer community.
